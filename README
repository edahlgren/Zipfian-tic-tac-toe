The George Kingsley Zipf AI Engine: Tic Tac Toe


A. To play

	Download the contents of this repository in a folder f

	Open a terminal

	cd /whateverpathto/f/

	type 
		python play.py


		You will notice that you always move first,
		and George Kingsley Zipf always moves second;
		this was to attack the problem of no-losses 
		starting with the disadvantaged player two.
		If this could be done, the solution would naturally
		carry to the advantaged player one as well.
		The program is flexible enough to make George
		move first, which is actually done in some of
		the tests (see below).


B. To run tests

	Again open a terminal and change directories 
	into f/

	type
		(your favorite editor) testgames.py
	
	follow the comments in the code to 
	unblock-out tests you desire to run, and save

	type
		python testgames.py


C. Documentation

	View Engine.pdf
	
		for details on the Decision making, the recursion,
		and for in-depth statistics on the AI

	View Tests.pdf
		
		for demonstration of the AI's fabulously 
		aggressive strategy and
		for an informal proof of the solution's completeness

	Each function is also documented in the code


D. About George Kingsley Zipf

	Open the About_Zipf folder
		
		includes: 
		a picture of George Kingsley Zipf himself!
		a short collection of biographies of statistical 
			linguists that I personally wrote, 
			which includes a nice description of George 
			Kingsley Zipf's personal history.
